## Criteria

For a plugin to be on this list requires 3 thing. First, it has to be actually free. I have no toleration for gating a "free" plugin behind pimping out emails or other kinds of personal data. And it also shouldn't need a 3rd party software for activation either (such as iLok). Secondly, the plugin needs to be well made with a clean and straightforward design so that it is easy to learn and easy to use (hopefully bug free too). And lastly, the plugin needs to be useful in many cases. A plugin that is used once and never again is not another tool in the proverbial production tool-belt, it's a piece of digital trash taking up real-estate on a harddrive and cluttering up space in a vst list.
